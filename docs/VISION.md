# Project: Void Covenant

**Design Document & Conceptual Manifesto (v3.0)**

### 1. The Vision

**Logistics without Limits.**
We reject the industrial clutter of pipes, wires, and conveyer belts. In a world of magic, logistics should be ethereal and instantaneous. **Void Covenant** proposes a storage system where distance is irrelevant and physical connection is unnecessary. The "network" is not built; it is inscribed upon reality itself.

### 2. Core Philosophy

- **Zero Infrastructure:** No cables. No pipes. No conduits. If a chunk is loaded, the system works.
- **Global Reach:** A chest 10,000 blocks away is just as connected as the furnace next to the core.
- **Entity-Based Logic:** The system operates through summoned entities and floating magical constructs, not static machine blocks.

### 3. Key Components

#### A. The Anomaly (The Heart)

- **Concept:** A tear in the spatial fabric of the world. It is the singular point where all items are suspended in timeless darkness.
- **Mechanic:** This is the only central structure. It does not have slots; it has capacity.
- **Stability:** The Anomaly is volatile. It requires physical **Anchors** (heavy chains/pillars) to prevent it from collapsing or consuming the base. Expanding storage means growing the Anomaly, which demands more Anchors.

#### B. The Covenant (The Interface)

- **Concept:** The "Wireless Terminal" reimagined as a summoned servant.
- **Visual:** A **Void Fairy** or similar bound spirit.
- **Mechanic:** The player does not click a block. They use a specific item (e.g., a Bell or Scroll) to summon the entity to their location.
- **Interaction:** The entity opens a personal, temporary rift, allowing the player to browse, deposit, and withdraw items from the central Anomaly anywhere in the world.

#### C. The Living Sigils (The Automation I/O)

- **Concept:** Floating, 3D runic constructs made of pure energy. These are sentient spells that bridge the gap between physical containers and the Void.
- **Visual:** Complex, rotating runes that hover in the air directly above a target block (chest, furnace, machine).
- **Types:**
    1. **Sigil of Absorption (Import):**
        - _Function:_ Continuously pulls items from the inventory below it.
        - _Visual:_ Rotates counter-clockwise. When it acts, it flares, and items dissolve into energy, teleporting instantly to the Anomaly.

    2. **Sigil of Manifestation (Export):**
        - _Function:_ Continuously pulls specific items _from_ the Anomaly and places them into the inventory below.
        - _Interface:_ interacting with the Sigil allows the player to set filters (e.g., "Keep 64 Coal in this furnace").
        - _Visual:_ Rotates clockwise. Items materialize from thin air into the container.

### 4. Gameplay Loop

    1. **The Tear:** The player performs a ritual to rip open the first **Anomaly** and anchors it to their base.
    2. **The Bind:** The player crafts the Summoning Tool to call the **Covenant Entity** for personal access.
    3. **The inscription:** The player travels to a distant mine or farm. They place a chest.
    4. **The Automation:** Instead of running a wire back to base, the player casts a **Sigil of Absorption** above the chest.
    5. **The Result:** Any item dropped in that chest is instantly vaporized by the Sigil and sent to the Anomaly at the main base. The logistics are invisible, magical, and infinite.
